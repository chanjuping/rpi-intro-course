# rpi-intro-course
Course written for beginners in Raspberry Pi development

The main file within here is at present, an fodt file that contains the guide written for using the Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu Server for the Raspberry Pi. Attempts have been made to make the guide as platform agnostic as possible for all versions of the Raspberry Pi.

The fodt format was used as it allows all the niceties of a full wysiwyg text editor like Libreoffice Writer, while being ensuring pull requests can be easily made to minor or major changes to the file.

This guide was written for users with an Ubuntu or other Linux distro as their main development machine.

Support and development for this class would not have been possible without the help of the [Penang Science Cluster](https://www.pscpen.com/).
